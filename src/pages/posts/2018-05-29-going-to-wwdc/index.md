Next week is WWDC week! I haven't posted in a long while, but I plan to do daily posts during the WWDC 2018 event. This will be the first time I get the chance to attend a WWDC event and I'm super excited to see what's in store for us iOS developers. I will try to share my thoughts and impressions from the event daily here on this blog, so stay tuned!
